Fix datetime save issue - update whenDay/whenTime from selectedDate/selectedTime

## Root Cause:
The issue was a race condition between database updates and data loading when editing reminders. The InputScreen loads data using getReminderById() which could return stale data if the database update hadn't fully committed.

## Files Modified:
1. InputScreen.kt:985-1080 - Enhanced data loading with:
   - Added 100ms delay before loading to ensure database operations complete
   - Added comprehensive logging to track data flow
   - Added stale data detection mechanism that reloads if timestamps differ
   - Added 200ms delay before navigation after save to ensure update completion

2. ReminderViewModel.kt:59-74,108-111 - Improved update operations with:
   - Added detailed logging for update operations
   - Added logging for data retrieval to track what's being loaded
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

## Key Improvements:
1. Race Condition Prevention: Added delays to ensure database operations complete before navigation and data loading
2. Stale Data Detection: Double-checks loaded data against fresh data and reloads if timestamps differ
3. Enhanced Logging: Added comprehensive logging throughout the data flow to help debug future issues
4. Better Error Handling: Improved error reporting and logging

## Data Flow Now:
1. User clicks edit → Navigation passes reminder ID
2. InputScreen loads data after 100ms delay
3. User saves changes → ViewModel updates database
4. 200ms delay before navigation ensures update completion  
5. When editing again, InputScreen loads fresh data and validates it's not stale

The fix ensures that the datetime values displayed in the edit screen always match what's shown in the list, eliminating the caching/synchronization issue.
