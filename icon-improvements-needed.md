# Icon Improvements Needed

## Current Issue
There are some weird icons in the app that need improvement for better user experience.

## Areas to Address
1. **Input Screen Title**: Currently using "📝" emoji which may not render consistently across all devices
2. **Alert Settings Icons**: Review all icons in alert settings for consistency and clarity
3. **Navigation Icons**: Ensure all navigation icons are intuitive and consistent

## Recommendations
1. Replace emoji icons with proper Material Design icons where possible
2. Ensure icon consistency across the entire app
3. Test icon rendering on different Android versions and device types
4. Consider accessibility implications of current icon choices

## Priority
- High: Input screen title icon
- Medium: Alert settings icons
- Low: General icon consistency improvements

## Implementation Notes
- Use Material Design Icons library for consistency
- Ensure proper contentDescription for accessibility
- Test on multiple screen densities
